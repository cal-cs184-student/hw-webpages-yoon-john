      <h2>Overview</h2>
      In this homework, I implement a raterizaterizer, with features to draw
      triangles, and smooth colors using barycentric coordinates, along with
      different sampling methods, including supersampling, pixel sampling, and
      level sampling. Through this project, I was able to learn how to implement
      the different features, and the benefits and drawbacks of difference
      sampling methods.

      <h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
      <p>
        I rasterize the triangle in 3 steps: finding the bounding box, checking
        the winding order of the vertices, and then sampling within the bounding
        box.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the bounding box, I simply compute the min and max of all the x and
        y coordinates of the given vertices, and this becomes the coordinate for
        my bounding box for the triangle.
      </p>
      <p>
        To check the winding order of the vertices, I compute the cross product
        of two consecutive edges, as we do in discussion 2, question 2. If the
        value is positive or zero, we do nothing, as the winding order is
        counterclockwise. If the value is negative, we swap the first two
        points, as the winding order is clockwise, and we want counterclockwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        To sample the triangle, we sample all the points + 0.5 in the previously
        found bounding box, and apply the Three Line Test. We compute the line
        equation for each point for all consecutive edges, and if the values of
        all three line equations are positive, we fill said pixel.
      </p>
      <p>
        We know that the algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample
        within the bounding box of the triangle, as the algorithm specifically
        checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle, and thus is
        the exact same.
      </p>

      <h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
      <p>
        I supersample the triangle in 3 steps: recreate the sample buffer, a
        vector of size (width x height x sample rate) to match the sample rate,
        sample the triangle within the larger sample buffer, and then down
        sample to match original frame buffer, by taking the average color of
        all the pixels for a certain pixel and inserting into rgb framebuffer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Supersampling is useful, as it drastically reduces the aliasing, or the
        jaggies that appear on the edges of the triangles, as it takes an
        average of the colors in a pixel, and some pixels have intermediate
        colors, making lines smoother.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the initial rasterization pipeline, some modifications were made.
        The previous pipeline is still used, but for a larger sample buffer,
        with coordinate values modified prior to the rasterization to fit the
        larger sample buffer. After the values are added to the sample buffer,
        it is downsampled, to match the frame buffer size, by taking an average
        of corresponding pixel colors in the sample buffer.
      </p>
      <p>
        This process antialiases the triangles, as taking averages for the color
        make the edges of the triangles appear smoother, especially when zoomed
        out.
      </p>

      <h2>Task 3: Transforms</h2>
      <img src="images/Task 3.png" width="600px" />
      <p>
        I try to make a swimming (now that I look at it, it looks more like
        flying) robot by first rotating the forearms, then adjusting the
        translation of the forearm to make it more natural, and then rotating
        the full robot.
      </p>

      <h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>
      <p>
        Barycentric coordinates is a method of linearly interpolating inside a
        triangle, so that given color values attached to vertices, each point
        inside the triangle take on different values with different weight for
        different vertex values. For example, in Figure 1 below, we utilize
        Barycentric coordinates to interpolate colors for each pixel inside the
        triangle. The leftmost vertex has color value corresponding to red,
        topmost vertex to blue, and the rightmost vertex to green. By
        calculating the proportion of the distances through the line equation of
        the opposite edge, we can calculate the weights for each of the vertex
        color values at each point, which is then combined to create a color
        value for each point inside the triangle. This creates a smoothly
        blended color triangle. This idea of Barycentric coordinate for
        triangular linear interpolation can be used not only for colors, but
        also for position, texture, and other attributes to make a smooth
        blended triangle.

      <h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>
      <p>
        Pixel sampling is a technique used, where we map a certain pixel from a
        texture space (or texel) to our frame’s pixels. To do this on a
        triangle, we first use similar technique as we did for previous
        iterations of rasterization using barycentric coordinates — using
        barycentric coordinates to find out the alpha beta gamma weights of each
        coordinates of the triangle. Now, instead of applying the weights on
        different colors, we apply them to each point of the texture
        coordinates. After getting the weighted texture coordinates, we pass
        them to either the sample nearest function, or the sample bilinear
        function.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both sampling function initially retrieves the mipmap given a level.
      </p>
      <p>
        The nearest sampling function scales the uv coordinate with the width
        and height of the mipmap, and then rounds the texture coordinates to the
        nearest integer value, and take the color at said texel.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bilinear sampling function also scales the uv coordinates withe the
        width and height of the mipamp, and finds the floor and ceiling of both
        the u and v coordinate, then find the 4 nearest sample texel colors.
        From here, we compute the vertical and horizontal fractional offset of s
        and t, then linearly interpolating horizontally twice using horizontal
        offest of s, and then vertically interpolating the two points to find
        our final color for our point, which we return.
      </p>

        </table>
      </div>
      <p>
        If we compare the output for nearest sampling and bilinear sampling, the
        differences become clearer. The differences between pixel colors are
        more stark when using nearest sampling, and more smooth when using
        bilinear sampling. This is more visible in the 1x sampling per pixel, as
        the 16x supersampling is able to smoothen the colors even when using
        nearest sampling.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is because the bilinear sampling takes a weighted sum of the 4
        nearest texel around our desired point. The difference between the two
        sampling methods are larger when there are high frequency details, such
        as sharp edges, fine textures, or drastic color changes, without using
        super sampling methods. This is because the nearest sampling will simple
        grab the nearest texel color, but the bilinear sampling will take into
        account all 4 colors around the point, allowing for a smoother texture
        when all colors are displayed.
      </p>

      <h2>Task 6: "Level Sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
      <p>
        Level sampling is a texture mapping technique that selects texels from a
        specific mipmap level based on the size of a pixel in texel space, then
        applies said color using different methods (level zero, nearest,
        linear). This means not always utilizing the full texture space to
        retrieve the sample, and using lower quality images that retrieve the
        necessary information, which is helpful for performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        For level zero sampling, we simply input level zero, which is equivalent
        to sampling accomplished in Task 5.
      </p>

      <p>
        As for nearest level or linear level sampling, we must compute the
        level. We implement this by first retrieving the barycentric texel
        coordinates for (x + 1, y) and (y, x + 1) that allow us to calculate the
        side length (scaled by image height and width) of the difference vectors
        between these and our sampling point of (x, y), which we use to
        calculate the mipmap level to use by applying log base 2. This level is
        then input into the nearest or bilinear sampling functions, based on the
        sampling mode used.
      </p>

      <p>
        For nearest level sampling, we compute this by rounding the float-based
        level we calculate previously into an integer, which is the mipmap level
        we input into the pixel sampling functions.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the linear level sampling, we compute the floor of the level, D, and
        compute level D+1. We then compute the color sampled from level D and
        D+1, and linearly interpolate the two colors with weight (difference
        between D and float-based level).
      </p>

      <p>
        There are tradeoffs between speed, memory usage, and antialiasing power
        between pixel sampling, level sampling, and supersampling.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pixel sampling is the quickest sampling method, as it simply samples a
        single pixel for each texel lookup. It also uses the least memory, as
        only the original texture is required for rasterization. However, the
        antialiasing power is limited using pixel sampling. This is improved
        when using bilinear pixel sampling, but then requires multiple lerp
        calculations, which lowers speed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Level sampling is slower than pixel sampling, as it needs to calculate
        the mipmap level based on texel width and height; however, this is
        somewhat improved by using lower resolution mipmap for higher level
        retrieval. It uses more memory than pixel sampling, as it requires
        storing mipmap levels, but is not seen as too much of a burden, as it
        only requires 4/3 of the memory of the original image. The antialiasing
        power is also better than pixel sampling, as it chooses the appropriate
        mipmap level based on distance and artifact size.
      </p>

      <p>
        Supersampling is also slower, especially at higher sampling rates, as it
        requires upscaling the images to a larger sample buffer, then
        downsampling by taking an average of the colors. It also uses the most
        memory, as an extra larger sample buffer is required to implement
        supersampling. However, it also has very good antialiasing power, as
        taking an average of multiple pixel samples results in smooth edges.
