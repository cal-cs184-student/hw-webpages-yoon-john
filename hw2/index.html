      <h2>Overview</h2>
      In this homework, I explore different geometric modeling concepts, like
      Bezier curves and surfaces with de Casteljau algorithm, along with its
      implementation. I also manipulate the triangle mesh using the half-edge
      data structure to implement area weight vertex normals, along with
      implementing different triangle mesh operations, like edge flip and slip,
      and finally implement loop subdivision. Through this homework, I learn the
      implementation of de Casteljau algorithm, and how to manipulate the half
      edge data structure to implement complex algorithms on 3d meshes, along
      with a deeper understanding of loop subdivision.

      <h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

      <h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
      <p>
        De Casteljau’s algorithm is a recursive algorithm to evalute Bezier
        curves. At each step, given n points, we linearly interpolate two
        adjacent points, to create n-1 intermediate points, given weight t
        between 0 and 1. recursively, we reach 1 final point, which is
        ultimately a point that lies on our Bezier curve, at parameter t.
      </p>
      <p>
        I implement this by iterating through the vector of input points, and
        calculating the lerp for point i and point i+1 for i at 0 to n-1, and
        add all these points to an return vector.
      </p>

      <h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
      <p>
        De Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces by applying it in
        different dimensions, and allows us to not only find a point on the
        Bezier curve in t, but find a point on the Bezier surface in u, v.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given an nxn matrix of points, we first evaluate the Bezier points in u
        for the n curves, which gives us n control points. To these n points, we
        can apply the algorithm again in v, allowing us to find a point on the
        Bezier surface in u, v.
      </p>

      <h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

      <h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
      <p>
        In this part, we implement the area-weighted vertex normal for Phong
        shading, for smoother shading. Given a vertex, our goal is to find all
        faces adjacent to the vertex, and weight its normal vector by its area,
        for a final normal vector.
      </p>
      <p>
        We first initialize a normal vector, where we will add all the weighted
        face normals. Then, given a vertex in the half edge mesh data structure,
        we call its half edge, and two next half edges. Because half edges are
        in triangles, and iterate counter-clockwise surrounding its face, these
        three half edges will correspond to the same face. Now, we call the
        vertex for each of these half edges to compute the positions v1, v2, and
        v3. Then, to find the area of the triangle, we first find the two edge
        vector v2 - v1 and v3 - v1. Then, we find the area of the triangle by
        computing the ½ the magnitude of the corss product of these edge
        vectors. Then, we check if the face is a boundary face. If it is not, we
        add the normal of the face with its corresponding weight to our normal
        vector. We iterate through all the face around our given vertex, and
        return the normal vector.
      </p>

      </div>

      <h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
      <p>
        In this part, we implement the Edge Flip operation. Given an edge (c,
        d), our goal is to flip the edge as show below:
      </p>

      <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center">
        <img src="images/Task 4 - diagram.png" width="400px" />
      </div>

      <p>
        I did this by first creating a variable for all mesh elements (half
        edges, edges, vertices, faces), so there is less confusion with pointers
        and accessing attributes. Afterwards, following the diagram, I first
        reassign the half edges of all faces, edges, and vertices. After this, I
        reassign the neighbors of all half edges using setNeighbors method.
      </p>

      <p>
        An issue I ran into was assuming all halfedges will have neighbors from
        the mesh elements that I’ve defined previously, which was not the case.
        I then realized some half edges might have other next half edges, and
        they might also have other faces.
      </p>

      <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center">
        <table
          style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse"

              <figcaption>teapot.dae after edge flips</figcaption>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>

      <h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
      <p>
        In this part, we implement the Edge Split operation. Given an edge (c,
        d), our goal is to flip the edge as show below:
      </p>

      <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center">
        <img src="images/Task 5 - diagram.png" width="400px" />
      </div>

      <p>
        Similar to how I implemented Edge Flip in the previous part, I did this
        by first creating variables for all mesh elements (half edges, edges,
        vertices, faces) by accessing them through the given edge. I also
        created the new mesh elements we need for the edge split(1 vertex, 2
        faces, 3 edges, 6 half edges). For the new vertex m, I set the position
        as the averages between the positions of v1 and v3, placing the new
        vertex in the middle of the two vertices.
      </p>

      <p>
        Afterwards, following the diagram, I first reassign the half edges of
        all faces, edges, and vertices. After this, I reassign the neighbors of
        all half edges using setNeighbors method.
      </p>

      <p>
        While listing out all the mesh elements was tedious at first, it made it
        easier for me to access and set attribute for different mesh
        elements,without much a of a debugging phase.
      </p>

      </div>

      <h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
      <p>
        In this part, we implement Loop subdivision operation. Given a coarse
        polygon mesh, our goal is to convert it in to a higher-resolution one,
        by doing the following operations:
      </p>
      <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center">
        <img src="images/Task 6 - diagram.png" width="400px" />
      </div>
      <p>
        We first calculate and store the new positions of new and old vertices
        into the newPosition attribute using the weight as follows:
      </p>
      <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center">
        <img src="images/Task 6 - weights.png" width="400px" />
      </div>

      <p>
        We then apply the splitEdge operation on all edges, and then apply the
        flipEdge operation on all new edges that connect an old and new vertex.
        To know whether a vertex or edge is new, we use the isNew attribute,
        which we reset at the end of the function for the next run of the
        subdivision.
      </p>

      <p>
        A debugging trick I used was to print a statement after each loop, to
        check which loop I was stuck at while running the subdivision. It turned
        out to be the splitEdge loop, and I had to change the condition for it
        to terminate as expected.
      </p>

      <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center">
        <table
          style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse"

            <td style="text-align: center">

            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>

      <p>
        After applying loop subdivision, the mesh becomes smoother in general.
        This effect is more pronounced for the sharp corners and edges, making
        the cube less and less like a cube. This is because the new position is
        an average of neighboring vertices positions, which make the positions
        smoother, and remove sharper corner and edges. Pre-splitting some edges
        reduces this effect, as presplitting some edges make it so that there
        are more points closer to the sharp edges, making the subdivided surface
        able to keep its sharp edges and corners. This is visible in the
        screenshot below.
      </p>
      <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center">
        <img src="images/Task 6 - pre split.png" width="400px" />
        <figcaption>Pre-split cube.dae</figcaption>
      </div>

      <p>
        Also, the loop subdivision also seem to cause asymmetric meshes when
        applied to the cube. This is likely due to uneven distrbution of edges,
        along with the direction of the edges going a certain way across the
        faces of the cube, causing the subdivision to favor one corner of the
        cube, making it asymmetric. By preprocessing the cube to flip and split
        the cube to create a more symetric edge and vertex topology. This allows
        for a more symmetric mesh when subdivided, as visible below.
